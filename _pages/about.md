**ðŸš§ Under Construction... ðŸš§**

Hi there! I am currently a last-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Fei Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wufei) and co-advised by Professor [Chao Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/chaowu).

My goal is to build a **democratized and distributed** AI infrastructure where **everyone** can participate in training large-scale foundation models on edge devices like smartphones. This initiative aims to make advanced AI accessible, efficient, and private for all people. To achieve this goal, my research focuses on three key pillars: (1) developing efficient on-device training methods and distributed **small-to-large** training for super-large foundation models, (2) designing heterogeneity-aware distributed learning algorithms that handle various data distributions and device capabilities, and (3) building a sustainable training infrastructure where diverse devices can **asynchronously** contribute to the **continual learning** of LLMs.

## Research Interests

**Research Areas:**

- Large-scale collaborative learning for large language models (LLMs)
- Distributed optimization under heterogeneous environment
- Asynchronous and continual/lifelong learning for LLMs
- Democratized and distributed AI infrastructure

I am actively seeking **postdoctoral positions**. If you have relevant opportunities or are interested in potential collaboration, please feel free to contact me via email.
